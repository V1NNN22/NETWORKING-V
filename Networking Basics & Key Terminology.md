## Types of Networks

### LAN (Local Area Network)
- Covers a **small area** (home, office, school).  
- Example: Wi-Fi in your house connecting phone, laptop, TV.  
- **Key point:** Fast, low-cost, private.  

---

### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- Covers a **city or large campus**.  
- Example: University campus network or city-wide ISP network.  
- **Key point:** Bigger than LAN, smaller than WAN.  

---

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Covers a **large area, even worldwide**.  
- Example: The **Internet** itself.  
- Connects LANs and MANs together.  
- **Key point:** Slower than LAN, expensive, connects across countries.  

---

### WLAN (Wireless LAN)
- A LAN that works **wirelessly** (Wi-Fi).  
- Example: Home or café Wi-Fi.  
- **Key point:** No cables, wireless signals only.  

---

### PAN (Personal Area Network)
- Very **small network** for personal devices.  
- Example: Phone connected to smartwatch via Bluetooth.  
- **Key point:** Short distance (a few meters).  

---

### CAN (Campus Area Network)
- Connects multiple LANs inside a **university, college, or company campus**.  
- Example: University labs, hostels, offices connected together.  
- **Key point:** Bigger than LAN, limited to one campus.  

---

### SAN (Storage Area Network)
- A network for **storing and managing data**.  
- Example: Banks, data centers, cloud storage providers.  
- **Key point:** Focuses on storage, not communication.
