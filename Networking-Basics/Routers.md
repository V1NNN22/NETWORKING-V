## üåê What is a Router?  
- **Definition:** A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.  
- **Purpose:** Connects multiple networks (e.g., LAN to WAN/Internet) and determines the **best path** for data transmission.  
- **Layer:** Operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.  

### üîë Key Functions  
- Packet forwarding (based on **IP addresses**).  
- Routing (selecting best path using **routing tables/protocols**).  
- Network segmentation & traffic management.  
- Security (basic firewall features, **NAT**).

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Routers  

### 1. Wired Router  
- Connects devices using **Ethernet cables**.  
- Provides **high-speed and reliable** connections.  
- Often used in **enterprise or office** networks.  

---

### 2. Wireless Router (Wi-Fi Router)  
- Provides both **wired and wireless** connectivity.  
- Common in **homes and small offices**.  
- Acts as **access point + router**.  

---

### 3. Core Router  
- High-capacity router used inside the **backbone of large ISPs or data centers**.  
- Handles **massive data traffic** at high speeds.  
- Does not connect directly to end-users.  

---

### 4. Edge Router (Gateway Router)  
- Sits at the **edge of a network**.  
- Connects internal networks to **external networks (e.g., Internet)**.  
- Can provide extra functions like **NAT, VPN**.  

---

### 5. Virtual Router  
- **Software-based router** (runs on a VM or cloud).  
- Provides **scalability and flexibility** in cloud networks.  
- Example: **VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**.  

---

### 6. Distribution Router  
- Connects multiple **access routers** together.  
- Used in larger **enterprise networks** for managing subnetworks.  

---

### 7. Branch Router  
- Installed at **branch offices**.  
- Provides **WAN connectivity** and local routing for smaller sites.

## ‚ö° Quick Recap (Router Types & Roles)  

| Router Type        | Usage |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Wired Router**   | Ethernet-based networks |
| **Wireless Router** | Home/office Wi-Fi + wired connections |
| **Core Router**    | ISP backbone, high-speed core traffic |
| **Edge Router**    | Connects LAN to Internet/WAN |
| **Virtual Router** | Cloud or software-based routing |
| **Distribution Router** | Connects access routers in enterprise |
| **Branch Router**  | Provides WAN/LAN for remote offices |
