## üìå What is the Physical Layer?
- **Definition:** The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model.  
  It is responsible for the **actual physical connection** between devices, transmitting raw bits (0s and 1s) over a communication medium.  

- **Purpose:**  
  - Defines the hardware, media, and signals used for data transmission.  
  - Ensures data is transmitted as **electrical, optical, or radio signals**.

## üîë Key Functions of the Physical Layer

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bit Transmission
- Converts **digital data into signals** (electrical, optical, or radio).  
- Sends and receives **raw bits** without interpretation.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Encoding & Signaling
- Defines how **0s and 1s** are represented as signals.  
- **Techniques:** NRZ (Non-Return to Zero), Manchester encoding, etc.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Transmission Medium
- Specifies the medium: **cables (copper, fiber optics)** or **wireless signals**.  
- Defines connector types, pinouts, and voltage levels.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Topology
- Describes how devices are physically connected: **bus, star, ring, mesh**.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Synchronization
- Ensures sender and receiver stay aligned for **correct bit interpretation**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Devices Operating at the Physical Layer
- Hubs  
- Repeaters  
- Cables (Ethernet, Fiber, Coaxial)  
- Network Interface Cards (NICs)  
- Connectors & Patch Panels  

---

## üì° Examples of Physical Layer Standards
- **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3):** Defines cabling & signaling.  
- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11):** Wireless transmission standards.  
- **DSL, ISDN:** Telecommunication standards.  
- **USB, Bluetooth:** Other transmission technologies.
