## 🌐 What is Subnetting?  
- **Definition:** Subnetting is the process of dividing a **large IP network** into **smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets)**.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Efficient **IP address utilization**.  
  - Improves **network performance & security**.  
  - Separates **broadcast domains**.  
- **Layer:** Works at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.  

---

## 📌 IP Address Structure (IPv4)  
- **IPv4 = 32 bits** → written in **dot-decimal notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
- Divided into:  
  - **Network Portion** → Identifies the network.  
  - **Host Portion** → Identifies a specific device in that network.  

### 🔑 Subnet Mask  
- A **32-bit number** that separates the **network portion** from the **host portion**.  

**Example:**
- IP: 192.168.1.10 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 → /24 (CIDR notation)
---

## ❓ Why Subnetting?  
- To divide a **large network** into smaller ones.  
- To **reduce broadcast traffic**.  
- To **improve security** (different departments = different subnets).  
- To make **routing more efficient**.

## 🧮 CIDR Notation  
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Uses a **suffix** (e.g., `/24`) to show how many bits are reserved for the **network portion**.  

| **CIDR** | **Subnet Mask**     | **Hosts per Subnet** |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| /24      | 255.255.255.0       | 254                   |
| /25      | 255.255.255.128     | 126                   |
| /26      | 255.255.255.192     | 62                    |
| /30      | 255.255.255.252     | 2 (useful for P2P)    |

## 📝 Subnetting Example  
**Given:** `192.168.1.0/24`  
**Requirement:** 4 subnets.  

**Solution:** Borrow **2 bits** from host portion (`/26`).  

**New Subnets:**  
- `192.168.1.0/26` → Hosts: 62  
- `192.168.1.64/26` → Hosts: 62  
- `192.168.1.128/26` → Hosts: 62  
- `192.168.1.192/26` → Hosts: 62

## ⚡ Quick Recap (Subnetting Basics)  

| **Concept**   | **Meaning** |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Subnetting** | Dividing a network into smaller subnets |
| **Subnet Mask** | Defines network vs host portion of IP |
| **CIDR** | Short notation (e.g., `/24 = 255.255.255.0`) |
| **Benefit** | Efficient IP use, security, performance |
