## Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching  

---

### Circuit Switching  
- **Definition:** A dedicated communication path (circuit) is established between sender and receiver for the entire duration of communication.  
- **How it works:**  
  - A fixed path is reserved before data starts flowing.  
  - All data travels along this single reserved path.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Traditional telephone networks.  
  - Old analog voice calls (once the line is connected, it remains fixed).  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Guaranteed and constant bandwidth.  
  - No delays once the connection is set.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Wastes resources if no data is being transmitted (line stays reserved).  
  - Not scalable for modern internet usage.  
- **Key Point:** Circuit Switching = Fixed, dedicated path for the whole call/session.

### Packet Switching  
- **Definition:** Data is broken into smaller units called packets, and each packet can take different routes to reach the destination.  
- **How it works:**  
  - Data is divided into packets with destination addresses.  
  - Packets may travel across different paths and are reassembled at the destination.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Internet (email, browsing, file sharing).  
  - VoIP (calls over the internet).  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Efficient use of network resources (no reserved lines).  
  - Fault tolerant — if one path fails, packets can take another.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Packets may be delayed or arrive out of order (needs reassembly).  
  - Slightly higher latency compared to a dedicated path.  
- **Key Point:** Packet Switching = Data split into packets, flexible paths, reassembled at the destination.

## Quick Comparison  
- **Circuit Switching** → Fixed path, dedicated connection, wasteful but reliable (like telephone calls).  
- **Packet Switching** → Data split into packets, flexible routing, efficient and scalable (like the internet).
