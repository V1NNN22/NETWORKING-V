## Bandwidth, Throughput, Latency, Jitter

### Bandwidth
- **Definition:** Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted through a network connection in a given time. Think of it as the width of a water pipe — the wider the pipe, the more water can flow through it at once.  
- **Measurement:** Bits per second (bps), commonly Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps (gigabits per second).  
- **Example:** A 100 Mbps internet plan means, at most, 100 megabits of data can move every second if the connection is fully utilized.  
- **Key Point:** Bandwidth is about capacity, not actual speed. It shows the maximum your connection can handle, not what you always get.

### Throughput
- **Definition:** Throughput is the actual amount of data successfully transmitted over the network. It tells us how much data really goes through the “pipe,” considering traffic, interference, and other issues.  
- **Why it differs from bandwidth:** Even if you have a 100 Mbps plan, you might only get 70–80 Mbps in real usage due to congestion, network overhead, or limitations of devices.  
- **Example:** Downloading a movie — if the file transfers at 80 Mbps while your plan allows 100 Mbps, your throughput is 80 Mbps.  
- **Key Point:** Throughput is about real performance. It’s usually less than bandwidth.

### Latency
- **Definition:** Latency is the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another in the network, usually measured in milliseconds (ms). It’s like the delay between asking a question and hearing the answer.  
- **Impact:** Low latency means quick response (good for gaming, video calls, financial trading). High latency means noticeable delays (bad for real-time communication).  
- **Example:** If you send a ping to a server and it responds in 20 ms, your latency is 20 ms. A server on the other side of the world may respond in 200 ms due to distance.  
- **Key Point:** Lower latency = faster responses. It matters more for real-time communication than for bulk downloads.

### Jitter
- **Definition:** Jitter is the variation in latency (the inconsistency of packet arrival times). Even if average latency is okay, if some packets are delayed much longer than others, communication suffers.  
- **Impact:** Especially harmful for video calls, voice calls, and online gaming, because data must arrive in a steady flow.  
- **Example:** If most packets arrive in 20 ms but a few arrive in 80 ms, the conversation may sound distorted or video may freeze.  
- **Key Point:** Consistency matters. Stable latency is better than fluctuating latency.

## Quick Reference
- **Bandwidth** → Maximum capacity of the connection (what it could carry)  
- **Throughput** → Actual data transferred (what it does carry)  
- **Latency** → Delay in data transmission (how long it takes)  
- **Jitter** → Variation in delay (how steady the connection is)
