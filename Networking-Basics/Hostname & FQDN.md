## What is a Hostname?  
- **Definition:** A hostname is a human-readable label assigned to a device (computer, server, router, etc.) in a network.  
- **Purpose:** Makes it easier to identify and access devices instead of remembering numerical IP addresses.  
- **Examples:**  
  - PC-01 (local computer name)  
  - server1 (internal network server)

## What is an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)?  
- **Definition:** An FQDN is the complete domain name that specifies the exact location of a host within the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy.  
- **Structure:** `[hostname].[domain].[top-level-domain]`  
- **Examples:**  
  - www.google.com  
  - mail.yahoo.co.in

## Difference Between Hostname & FQDN  

| Aspect   | Hostname | FQDN |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Meaning** | Device name in a network | Complete domain path in DNS hierarchy |
| **Scope**   | Local / internal use | Global / internet-wide unique name |
| **Format**  | Single label (e.g., `server1`) | Multiple labels ending with TLD (e.g., `server1.example.com`) |
| **Example** | PC-01 | pc01.company.com |

## Quick Recap  
- **Hostname** → Simple name for a device (local identifier).  
- **FQDN** → Full path in DNS, unique across the internet.
