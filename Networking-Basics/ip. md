## 🌐 What is an IP Address?  
- **Definition:** An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a **unique identifier** assigned to each device on a network to enable communication.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Identify devices on a network.  
  - Enable **routing of data packets**.  
  - Distinguish between different networks and hosts.  
- **Layer:** Operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.

## 🛠️ IP Address Types  

### 1. IPv4  
- **32-bit address** → dot-decimal notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
- Divided into **Network** and **Host** portions.  
- Supports ~4.3 billion addresses.  

### 2. IPv6  
- **128-bit address** → hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:0db8::1`).  
- Designed to solve **IPv4 address exhaustion**.  
- Supports virtually **unlimited addresses**.

## 🏷️ IP Address Classes (IPv4)  

| Class | Range       | Network/Host Info | Use              |
|-------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| A     | 1–126      | N.H.H.H         | Large networks  |
| B     | 128–191    | N.N.H.H         | Medium networks |
| C     | 192–223    | N.N.N.H         | Small networks  |
| D     | 224–239    | Multicast       | Multicast       |
| E     | 240–254    | Experimental    | Research        |

## 🌍 Public vs Private IPs  
- **Public IP:** Routable on the internet, globally unique.  
- **Private IP:** Used within internal networks, not routable on the internet.  

**Private IPv4 Ranges:**  
- Class A → `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`  
- Class B → `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`  
- Class C → `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`

## 🔄 Static vs Dynamic IPs  
- **Static IP:** Manually assigned, doesn’t change. Useful for **servers**.  
- **Dynamic IP:** Assigned by **DHCP server**, may change over time. Common for **client devices**.  

---

## 🖥️ What is IP Addressing?  
- **Definition:** IP addressing is the method of assigning **IP addresses** to devices in a network.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Ensure each device has a **unique address**.  
  - Facilitate **communication** between devices.  
  - Enable **proper routing of packets** across networks.  

---

## 🛠️ Methods of IP Address Assignment  

### 1. Manual / Static Assignment  
- Configured by **network admin**.  
- Stable and predictable.  

### 2. Dynamic Assignment (DHCP)  
- Automatically assigns addresses from a **pool**.  
- Reduces admin effort.  
- Supports **address reuse**.  

### 3. APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)  
- Used when **DHCP fails** (`IPv4: 169.254.x.x`).  
- Enables **basic local communication**.

## 🔗 Subnetting & IP Addressing Connection  
- Subnetting allows **efficient use of IP addresses**.  
- Helps in organizing **network IDs** and **host IDs**.  
- Reduces **broadcast domains** and improves **network performance**.

## ⚡ Quick Recap (IP Addresses & Addressing)  

| Concept             | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| **IP Address**       | Unique identifier for network devices |
| **IPv4 / IPv6**      | Address formats |
| **Static / Dynamic** | Manual vs automatic assignment |
| **Private / Public** | Internal vs Internet-routable addresses |
| **Subnetting**       | Divides IP networks into smaller subnets for efficiency |
