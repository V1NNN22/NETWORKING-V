## 📌 What is Network Security?  
- **Definition:** Network security is the practice of **protecting data, devices, and resources** in a computer network from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or attacks.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Safeguards **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)** of data.  
  - Prevents **cyberattacks, data breaches, and malware infections**.  
  - Ensures **secure communication** across networks.  
- **Layer:** Security applies across **multiple OSI layers** (from **Physical to Application**).

## 🔑 Key Components of Network Security  
1. **Confidentiality** – Data accessible only to authorized users (*encryption, access control*).  
2. **Integrity** – Prevents unauthorized changes to data (*hashing, digital signatures*).  
3. **Availability** – Keeps services reliable and accessible (*redundancy, backups, DDoS protection*).

## 🚨 Common Network Security Threats  
- **Malware** → Viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware.  
- **Phishing** → Tricks users into revealing sensitive data.  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** → Attacker intercepts communication.  
- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** → Overloads systems to disrupt service.  
- **Unauthorized Access** → Exploiting weak credentials or misconfigurations.

## 🛠️ Network Security Measures  
1. **Firewalls** – Block unauthorized access based on rules.  
2. **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** – Detect and block suspicious traffic.  
3. **Antivirus & Anti-malware** – Protects endpoints from malicious software.  
4. **Encryption (SSL/TLS, VPNs)** – Secures data in transit.  
5. **Authentication & Authorization** – Ensures only legitimate users/devices gain access.  
6. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – Restrict traffic based on policies.  
7. **Patch Management** – Keeps systems updated to fix vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Best Practices for Network Security  
- Use **strong passwords** and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.  
- Regularly **update and patch** systems.  
- Enable **firewalls** and **antivirus protection**.  
- Segment networks with **VLANs** for isolation.  
- Monitor traffic with **logging and SIEM tools**.  
- **Educate users** about phishing and social engineering.
