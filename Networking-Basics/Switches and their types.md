## üîå What is a Switch?  
- **Definition:** A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a **LAN (Local Area Network)** and forwards data frames based on **MAC addresses**.  
- **Purpose:** Improves network efficiency by sending data **only to the intended device** (unlike a hub, which broadcasts to all).  
- **Layer:** Operates mainly at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model, but some advanced switches operate at **Layer 3**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Switches  

### 1. Unmanaged Switch  
- **Plug-and-play**, no configuration required.  
- Common in **home or small office** setups.  
- Inexpensive, **limited functionality**.  

---

### 2. Managed Switch  
- Allows **configuration and monitoring** (via CLI, web interface, SNMP).  
- Supports **VLANs, QoS, security, redundancy**.  
- Used in **enterprise and data center** networks.  

---

### 3. Layer 2 Switch  
- Operates at **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**.  
- Forwards frames based on **MAC addresses**.  
- Suitable for **LAN environments**.  

---

### 4. Layer 3 Switch (Multilayer Switch)  
- Works at both **Layer 2 & Layer 3**.  
- Performs **switching + basic routing** functions.  
- Useful in large networks where **LAN and routing functions** are combined.  

---

### 5. PoE Switch (Power over Ethernet)  
- Provides both **power and data** through Ethernet cables.  
- Commonly used for **IP cameras, VoIP phones, wireless access points**.  

---

### 6. Stackable Switch  
- Multiple switches can be **interconnected and managed as a single unit**.  
- Improves **scalability and redundancy**.  

---

### 7. Fixed vs Modular Switch  
- **Fixed Switch:** Limited number of built-in ports, cannot be expanded.  
- **Modular Switch:** Has slots/modules for **expansion** (e.g., add more ports, fiber modules).

## ‚ö° Quick Recap (Switch Types & Uses)  

| Switch Type       | Role / Use Case |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Unmanaged Switch** | Simple, small networks, no configuration |
| **Managed Switch**   | Enterprise networks, VLANs, monitoring |
| **Layer 2 Switch**   | LAN switching, MAC-based forwarding |
| **Layer 3 Switch**   | Switching + basic routing functions |
| **PoE Switch**       | Powers devices like IP cameras, VoIP, APs |
| **Stackable Switch** | Scalability, redundancy in growing networks |
| **Fixed Switch**     | Limited, cost-effective, no expansion |
| **Modular Switch**   | Flexible, expandable, used in data centers |
