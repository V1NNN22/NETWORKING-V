# Networking Basics & Key Terminology

# Written By: Vinod N. Rathod


## Wireless Media: Radio, Microwave, Satellite

### 1. Radio Waves

* **Definition:** Data is transmitted using radio frequency signals through the air.
* **Range:** Short to medium range (a few meters to a few kilometers).
* **Uses:**

  * Wi-Fi
  * Bluetooth
  * FM/AM radio
  * Cordless phones
* **Advantages:**

  * No cables required, flexible and cheap
  * Works well indoors and outdoors
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Easily affected by interference (walls, other signals)
  * Limited range and speed compared to other wireless media
* **Key Point:** Radio = everyday short-range communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

### 2. Microwaves

* **Definition:** Data is transmitted as high-frequency radio signals in straight lines between antennas.
* **Range:** Medium range (a few kilometers to tens of kilometers).
* **Uses:**

  * Point-to-point communication between buildings
  * Mobile phone towers
  * Long-distance telephone and internet backhaul
* **Advantages:**

  * Can transmit large amounts of data
  * Cheaper than laying cables for long distances
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Needs line-of-sight (no large obstacles between antennas)
  * Affected by weather (rain, fog)
* **Key Point:** Microwaves = medium-distance, high-speed links (cell towers, building-to-building).

### 3. Satellite Communication

* **Definition:** Data is transmitted to a satellite in space, which then relays it back to a ground station or another satellite.
* **Range:** Global coverage (thousands of kilometers).
* **Uses:**

  * TV broadcasting (DTH)
  * GPS (Global Positioning System)
  * Satellite internet (Starlink, VSAT)
  * Military and space communication
* **Advantages:**

  * Can cover remote/rural areas where cables or towers can’t reach
  * Provides worldwide coverage
* **Disadvantages:**

  * High latency (delay due to long distance to satellite)
  * Expensive equipment and bandwidth costs
  * Weather conditions can affect signal
* **Key Point:** Satellite = long-distance, global communication.

## Quick Comparison

* **Radio:** Short-range → Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM/AM
* **Microwave:** Medium-range, line-of-sight → Cell towers, point-to-point links
* **Satellite:** Long-range, global → GPS, TV broadcasting, remote internet
