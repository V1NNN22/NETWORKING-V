Written By: Vinod N. Rathod

## üìå What is Network Access Control (NAC)?
- **Definition:** NAC is a security solution that enforces policies to control which devices and users can access a network, ensuring that only **authorized and compliant devices** connect.
- **Purpose:** 
  - Protects networks from unauthorized access.
  - Enforces security policies.
  - Reduces the risk of malware or breaches.
- **Layer:** Works across multiple OSI layers depending on implementation (Network, Data Link, Application).

## üîë Key Components of NAC

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication & Authorization
- Verifies **user identity** before granting access.
- Ensures devices meet **security compliance standards**.
- **Techniques:** 802.1X authentication, Active Directory integration, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Endpoint Compliance
- Checks devices for antivirus, patches, OS version, and configuration compliance.
- Non-compliant devices may be **quarantined or restricted**.
- **Techniques:** Health checks, endpoint posture assessment, automated remediation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Policy Enforcement
- Defines rules for **who/what can access network resources**.
- Can restrict access based on **user role, device type, location, or time**.
- **Techniques:** VLAN assignment, Access Control Lists (ACLs), role-based access control.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Reporting
- Continuously monitors connected devices and user activities.
- Generates alerts and reports for **suspicious behavior or policy violations**.
- **Techniques:** Logs, dashboards, automated alerts.

## ‚ö° NAC Workflow
1. **User/Device attempts network access**  
2. **Authentication & Authorization** ‚Äì Verify identity and credentials  
3. **Endpoint Compliance Check** ‚Äì Assess device posture  
4. **Policy Enforcement** ‚Äì Grant, restrict, or quarantine access  
5. **Monitoring & Reporting** ‚Äì Log activity and alert anomalies

## ‚úÖ Quick Recap (NAC in Network Security)

| Component             | Goal                                  | How It‚Äôs Ensured                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Authentication        | Allow only authorized users/devices  | 802.1X, Active Directory, MFA            |
| Endpoint Compliance   | Ensure devices meet security standards | Health checks, antivirus, patch management |
| Policy Enforcement    | Control access based on rules         | VLANs, ACLs, role-based access           |
| Monitoring & Reporting | Detect and respond to violations     | Logs, dashboards, automated alerts       |

## üí° Advantages of NAC
- Prevents unauthorized access.  
- Ensures compliance with security policies.  
- Reduces risk of malware and breaches.  
- Provides visibility into network devices and users.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of NAC
- Complex to deploy in large networks.  
- Requires integration with multiple systems (AD, endpoints, etc.).  
- May impact user experience if misconfigured.
