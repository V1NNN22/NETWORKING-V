## üìå What is the CIA Triad?  
- **Definition:** The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model in information security that defines the **three core principles** for protecting data and systems.  
- **Purpose:** Provides a **framework** for designing, implementing, and evaluating **security policies & controls**.

## üîë The Three Components of the CIA Triad  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Confidentiality  
- Ensures data is accessible **only to authorized users**.  
- Protects against **unauthorized access, disclosure, or theft**.  
- **Techniques:** Encryption, access controls, authentication, VPNs.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrity  
- Ensures data remains **accurate, consistent, and unaltered** during storage or transmission.  
- Protects against **unauthorized modification or corruption**.  
- **Techniques:** Hashing, digital signatures, checksums, version control.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Availability  
- Ensures data & systems are **accessible when needed** by authorized users.  
- Protects against **downtime, DoS attacks, or hardware failures**.  
- **Techniques:** Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery (DR), load balancing.

## ‚ö° Quick Recap (CIA Triad in Security)  

| **Principle**     | **Goal**                         | **How It‚Äôs Ensured**                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Prevent unauthorized access      | Encryption, access controls, VPN                   |
| **Integrity**       | Prevent unauthorized modification| Hashing, checksums, digital signatures             |
| **Availability**    | Ensure data/system accessibility | Redundancy, backups, load balancers, DR plans      |
