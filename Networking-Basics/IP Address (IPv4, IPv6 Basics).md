## IP Address (IPv4, IPv6 Basics)  


### What is an IP Address?  
- **Definition:** An IP (Internet Protocol) Address is a unique logical identifier assigned to a device in a network so it can communicate with other devices.  
- **Purpose:** Works like a postal address — helps data find the correct sender and receiver across networks.  
- **Layer:** Operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)  
- **Format:** 32-bit address, written in four decimal numbers separated by dots.  
  - Example: 192.168.1.1  
- **Address space:** Around 4.3 billion addresses available.  
- **Usage:** Most common and widely used version today.  
- **Types of IPv4 addresses:**  
  - Public IP: Unique and accessible from the internet.  
  - Private IP: Used inside local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x).  
- **Limitation:** Limited number of addresses → led to development of IPv6.

### IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)  
- **Format:** 128-bit address, written in eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.  
  - Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334  
- **Address space:** Virtually unlimited (340 undecillion addresses) → solves IPv4 exhaustion problem.  
- **Features:**  
  - Built-in security (IPsec support).  
  - Better efficiency and routing.  
  - No need for NAT (Network Address Translation).  
- **Usage:** Gradually being adopted worldwide.

## IPv4 vs. IPv6 (Quick Comparison)  
- **IPv4** → 32-bit, dot-decimal format, ~4.3 billion addresses.  
- **IPv6** → 128-bit, hexadecimal format, virtually unlimited addresses.  
- **IPv4** → Still dominant today but running out.  
- **IPv6** → Future standard, slowly replacing IPv4.
