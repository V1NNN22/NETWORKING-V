# 🌐 TCP/IP Model – Layer 2 (Internet Layer)

## 📘 What is the Internet Layer?

**Definition:**  
The **Internet Layer** is the **second layer** of the TCP/IP model.  
It is responsible for **logical addressing**, **routing**, and **packet delivery** across different networks.

**Purpose:**  
Ensures that **data packets travel** from the source network to the destination network — regardless of the physical path.  
It focuses on **finding the best route** for data transmission.

## ⚙️ Key Functions of the Internet Layer

### 1️⃣ Logical Addressing
- Assigns **IP addresses** to devices.  
- Differentiates between devices and networks using **logical (IP) addresses**.

---

### 2️⃣ Routing
- Determines the **best path** for packets to reach their destination.  
- Uses **routing tables** and **routing protocols** (like OSPF, BGP, RIP).

---

### 3️⃣ Packet Encapsulation & Decapsulation
- **Encapsulates** data from higher layers into IP packets for transmission.  
- **Decapsulates** packets at the receiver’s end for further processing.

---

### 4️⃣ Fragmentation & Reassembly
- Breaks large packets into **smaller fragments** to fit transmission media limits.  
- **Reassembles** them correctly at the destination device.

---

### 5️⃣ Error Reporting & Diagnostics
- Detects and reports issues such as **unreachable hosts or networks**.  
- Uses **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** for diagnostics (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`).

---

## 🖥️ Devices Operating at the Internet Layer
- **Routers**  
- **Layer 3 Switches**  
- **Firewalls** (for IP packet filtering and inspection)

## 🌐 Examples of Internet Layer Protocols

| **Protocol** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **IP (Internet Protocol)** | Core protocol for addressing and routing (IPv4 / IPv6) |
| **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** | Used for error reporting and diagnostics |
| **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** | Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses |
| **RARP (Reverse ARP)** | Maps MAC addresses to IP addresses |

## ⚡ Quick Recap (Internet Layer in TCP/IP)

| **Aspect** | **Role / Example** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Data Unit** | Packets |
| **Addressing** | Logical (IP Address) |
| **Functions** | Routing, addressing, fragmentation |
| **Devices** | Routers, firewalls |
| **Protocols** | IP, ICMP, ARP, RARP |

### 💡 The Internet Layer = “The Routing & Addressing Layer”  
⚡ It ensures that **data can travel between networks** and **reach the correct destination** reliably.
