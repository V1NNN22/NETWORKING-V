# 🧨 Zero Trust Reality #5: “Least Privilege” Is Mostly a Lie We Tell Auditors

## Written By: Vinod Rathod 

Everyone claims it.  
Almost nobody enforces it.

Least privilege exists mainly in **diagrams** and **compliance PDFs**.

The belief:

> “Users and services only have the permissions they need.”

That sentence alone has caused more breaches than malware.

## ❌ Why Least Privilege Collapses in Real Systems

### 1️⃣ Nobody Knows What Is *Actually* Needed

Modern apps are spaghetti:

- Microservices calling microservices  
- Feature flags toggling paths at runtime  
- Rare admin workflows triggered once a quarter  

So permissions get widened *“temporarily”*.

Temporary becomes permanent.  
Always.

### 2️⃣ Cloud IAM Encourages Permission Hoarding

When things break, engineers do one thing:

> “Just give it Admin so prod comes back.”

Result:

- `*:*` policies  
- Broad roles reused everywhere  
- Service accounts that can destroy entire regions  

Least privilege loses to uptime every time.

### 3️⃣ Humans Are Terrible at Subtraction

Adding permissions is easy.  
Removing them is scary.

Nobody wants to be the person who broke payroll because they cleaned up an old policy.

So permissions accumulate like **digital plaque**.

---

### 4️⃣ Service Identities Are Worse Than Humans

Humans leave.  
Service accounts don’t.

- Old pipelines still have tokens  
- Deprecated apps still authenticate  
- Forgotten cron jobs still run  

Attackers love non-human identities:

- They don’t complain  
- They don’t rotate passwords  
- They don’t notice abuse

## 🧨 The Dirty Secret

Least privilege is **not a state**.

It’s a **continuous process**, and most orgs run it once during onboarding and never again.

Zero Trust doesn’t fail because the idea is bad.  
It fails because nobody maintains it.

---

## ✅ What Works Instead of Pretending

- Start with **deny-by-default**, suffer briefly, then stabilize  
- Auto-expire permissions like secrets  
- Just-in-time access for humans *and* services  
- Continuous permission trimming based on real usage  
- Alerts when identities use permissions they never used before  

---

## 🧠 Final Reality Check

If removing a permission terrifies you,  
your system is already broken.

Least privilege isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about **constant discomfort, enforced automatically**.
