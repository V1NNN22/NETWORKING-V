# ☁️ “Zero Trust” Isn’t Zero Trust  
## It’s Zero Attention

Everyone says they run **Zero Trust**.  
What they actually run is **Perimeter Security with Better Marketing**.

**The slogan**

> “Never trust, always verify”

**The implementation**

- Trusts anything inside the VPC  
- Trusts service accounts forever  
- Trusts IP ranges like it’s still 2009  
- Verifies once, then naps indefinitely  

So no, that’s not Zero Trust.  
That’s **Trust, but Rename It**.

## 🧠 Where Zero Trust Breaks in the Real World

### 1️⃣ Identity Becomes the New Perimeter

**Old world:**

Firewall decides.

**New world:**

Identity token decides.

**Problem:**

- Tokens live too long  
- Tokens get copied  
- Tokens get logged  
- Tokens get reused  

Attackers don’t break authentication.  
They **inherit it**.

### 2️⃣ Internal Traffic Is Still Treated Like Family

Inside the cloud:

- East–west traffic wide open  
- Flat networks everywhere  
- “It’s internal” logic somehow survives  

Once an attacker gets *any* workload:

- Lateral movement is a scenic walk  
- No exploits required  
- Just API calls and patience  

Zero Trust at the edge.  
Zero curiosity inside.

### 3️⃣ Policies Are Written Once and Fossilized

Zero Trust assumes:

- Policies are precise  
- Policies evolve  
- Policies are reviewed  

Reality:

- Wildcards everywhere  
- “Temporary” permissions from 2 years ago  
- No one knows why a service can do 37 things  

Authorization entropy always wins.

### 4️⃣ Visibility Is Missing Where It Matters

Teams log:

- Login success  
- Login failure  

They don’t log:

- What identity accessed what  
- From where  
- At what frequency  
- With what blast radius  

So when things go wrong:

- You know *someone* logged in  
- You don’t know **what burned**

## 🧨 The Uncomfortable Truth

Zero Trust is **not**:

- A product  
- A checkbox  
- A diagram  

It **is**:

- Short-lived identity  
- Constant re-verification  
- Aggressive segmentation  
- Loud, detailed visibility  
- Policies you’re afraid to write because they might actually break things  

If your system still assumes **“inside = safer”**,  
you don’t have Zero Trust.  

You have **Zero Follow-Through**.
