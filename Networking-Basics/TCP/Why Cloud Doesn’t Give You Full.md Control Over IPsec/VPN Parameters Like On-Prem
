# ☁️ Why Cloud Doesn’t Give You Full Control Over IPsec/VPN Parameters Like On-Prem

## 🌥️ The Core Question

Why do cloud VPN services (AWS VPN, Azure VPN Gateway, GCP VPN) restrict IPsec parameters like algorithms, timers, MTU, DPD, PFS, and advanced routing—while on-prem VPN appliances let you tweak everything?

**Short Answer:**  
Because cloud VPNs are shared, managed, auto-scaling, multi-tenant services where low-level configurability would break isolation, HA behavior, interoperability, and provider reliability. Cloud VPN is a *service*, not your hardware.

## 🧩 1. On-Prem VPN Appliances = Full Custom Control

Traditional VPN devices let you modify:

- Phase 1/2 lifetimes  
- Encryption algorithms  
- DH groups  
- MTU & MSS  
- PFS settings  
- DPD intervals  
- Replay settings  
- Tunnel interfaces  
- BGP timers, local-pref, MED  
- IKEv1/v2 modes  

Why?  
**You own the hardware** → complete control = no restrictions.

---

## ☁️ 2. Cloud VPNs Run on Shared, Virtual Gateways

Cloud VPNs:

- run on shared nodes  
- terminate thousands of tunnels  
- scale and heal automatically  
- use provider-managed crypto engines  
- abstract hardware  
- participate in SDN fabric  

You do **not** get direct access to the appliance.

Cloud VPN ≠ Your ASA / FortiGate.  
Cloud VPN = Managed multi-tenant cluster service.

## 🔐 3. Reason 1: Security Standardization

If cloud allowed fully custom settings:

- customers could use weak crypto  
- misaligned timers would break tunnels  
- HA failovers would fail  
- old, insecure algorithms would persist  
- compliance (FIPS, PCI, FedRAMP) would break  

Cloud enforces:

- AES-128/256  
- SHA-256  
- Strong DH groups  
- Fixed lifetimes  

Standardized → predictable → secure → compliant.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Reason 2: Multi-Tenant Infrastructure Cannot Support Custom Tuning

Cloud VPN nodes support thousands of customers.

If each could tweak:

- MTU  
- timers  
- DH groups  
- DPD intervals  
- fragmentation  
- routing preferences  

… the entire cluster would break.

Uniform parameters = stable shared infrastructure.

---

## 📡 5. Reason 3: Underlay Is Proprietary, Not Traditional IPsec Hardware

Cloud VPN gateways run on:

- distributed SDN nodes  
- virtual crypto accelerators  
- multi-AZ HA routers  
- internal backbone routing  

These are **not**:

- ASA  
- Palo Alto  
- Fortinet  
- Juniper  

Cloud cannot expose internal knobs without breaking abstraction.

---

## 🔌 6. Reason 4: Cloud Requires Auto-Healing and Auto-Scaling

Dynamic settings break:

- tunnel migration  
- cluster failover  
- AZ failover  
- automatic scaling  
- HA renegotiation  
- internal redundancy  

To maintain reliability, cloud VPNs must enforce fixed parameters.

Custom knobs = broken HA.

---

## 🧱 7. Reason 5: Cloud Must Guarantee Interoperability With Every Device

Cloud VPNs must work with:

- Cisco  
- Juniper  
- Fortigate  
- PFsense  
- Palo Alto  
- Mikrotik  
- SD-WAN devices  

Predictable settings ensure:

- universal compatibility  
- easier troubleshooting  
- consistent support  

Full customization = chaos.

---

## 🌐 8. Reason 6: MTU & Fragmentation Are Fixed by Cloud Fabric

Cloud fabric uses:

- overlays  
- encapsulation  
- virtual NICs  
- hypervisor routing  

These impose:

- fixed MTU limits  
- fixed fragmentation behavior  
- provider-defined MSS clamps  

You cannot modify these without breaking the entire SDN pipeline.

---

## 🔍 9. What You *Can* Control in Cloud VPNs

Cloud allows configuration of:

- pre-shared keys  
- BGP vs static routes  
- tunnel inside IPs  
- customer/on-prem CIDRs  
- preferred tunnel priority  
- route propagation behavior  

Cloud exposes only the safe, stable knobs.

Everything else stays locked.

## 🚀 10. Summary Table

| Feature | On-Prem VPN | Cloud VPN | Why Restricted |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Crypto settings | Fully customizable | Limited | Security standardization |
| MTU | Adjustable | Fixed | Overlay / SDN constraints |
| P1/P2 timers | Fully configurable | Fixed | HA stability |
| Tunnel interfaces | Full control | None | Multi-tenant abstraction |
| BGP tuning | Advanced | Minimal | Simplification + reliability |
| DPD/Replay knobs | Fully tunable | Restricted | Predictable failover |
| Underlay | Visible | Hidden | Provider security |

## 🧠 In Simple Terms

**On-prem VPN = your hardware → complete control.**  
**Cloud VPN = shared, auto-scaling, multi-tenant service → strict standardization.**

Cloud VPN restrictions exist to maintain reliability, security, interoperability, and HA across millions of tunnels worldwide.
