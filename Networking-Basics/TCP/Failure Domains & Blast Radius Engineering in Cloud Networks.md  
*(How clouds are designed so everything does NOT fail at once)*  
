## Failure Domains & Blast Radius Engineering in Cloud Networks  
*(How clouds are designed so everything does NOT fail at once)*

## 🧠 What is a Failure Domain?

**Definition:**  
A Failure Domain is a **logical or physical boundary** within which a failure can occur **without impacting systems outside that boundary**.

In simple words:
> “How much breaks when one thing breaks?”

Cloud networking is not about preventing failures.  
It is about **containing failures**.

---

## 🎯 Why Failure Domains Matter

Reality check:

- Hardware fails  
- Software bugs ship  
- Humans make mistakes  
- Networks partition  
- Regions go dark  

If your design assumes “this won’t fail,”  
you already lost.

Failure-domain design answers:
- *What is allowed to fail?*
- *How far can the failure spread?*
- *What keeps running?*

## 🧱 Types of Failure Domains in Cloud Networking

---

## 1️⃣ Physical Failure Domains

These are **real-world boundaries**.

Examples:
- Rack  
- Power supply  
- Top-of-Rack switch  
- Data center building  

If a ToR switch dies:
- Everything under it dies  
- Everything above it should not  

Cloud providers design networks so:
- One physical failure does not cascade upward  

---

## 2️⃣ Availability Zone (AZ)

An AZ is a **carefully engineered failure domain**.

Characteristics:
- Independent power  
- Independent cooling  
- Independent networking  
- Low-latency links between AZs  

AZs are designed so:
> One AZ can burn down, others stay alive.

If your app runs in one AZ,  
you chose a big blast radius.

---

## 3️⃣ Region-Level Failure Domain

Regions are:
- Geographically isolated  
- Electrically isolated  
- Legally isolated  

Region failures are rare — but catastrophic.

Examples:
- Natural disasters  
- Massive power grid failures  
- Control-plane outages  

Multi-region designs exist **only** to survive this.

---

## 4️⃣ Network Failure Domains

Inside a cloud network, failures are segmented by:

- Subnet  
- VPC / VNet  
- Routing table  
- Load balancer  
- Control-plane shard  

A good network design ensures:
- Route failures don’t propagate globally  
- One VPC’s mistake doesn’t kill others  

---

## 🌐 What is Blast Radius?

**Definition:**  
Blast Radius is the **scope of impact** caused by a failure.

Think of it as:
> “How many things die because of one bad event?”

Small blast radius = survivable  
Large blast radius = incident report + apology blog

---

## 💥 Common Causes of Large Blast Radius

### 1️⃣ Shared Everything

Examples:
- One NAT Gateway for everything  
- One load balancer for all services  
- One firewall policy applied globally  

Failure becomes universal.

---

### 2️⃣ Global Control-Plane Dependencies

Examples:
- One config service for all regions  
- One DNS zone with aggressive TTLs  
- One identity provider without caching  

Control-plane failure = global outage.

---

### 3️⃣ Over-Automation Without Limits

Automation mistakes scale instantly.

Example:
- Bad security rule  
- Auto-applied everywhere  
- Network drops across all services  

Automation without guardrails is just fast failure.

---

## 🧱 Blast Radius Reduction Techniques

---

### 1️⃣ Fault Isolation by Design

Design rule:
> “No single component should be mandatory for everything.”

Techniques:
- Multiple NATs  
- Multiple load balancers  
- Per-AZ resources  
- Scoped policies  

---

### 2️⃣ Cell-Based Architecture

Cloud providers use **cells**:

- Small, independent units  
- Own networking  
- Own control-plane slice  

If one cell dies:
- Only its workloads die  

This is how hyperscalers survive chaos.

---

### 3️⃣ Scoped Networking Policies

Bad policy:
Allow/Deny everywhere

Good policy:
Allow/Deny only for this VPC, AZ, or service

Smaller scope = smaller blast radius.

---

### 4️⃣ Multi-AZ and Multi-Region Routing

Traffic should:
- Automatically avoid failed zones  
- Gracefully degrade  
- Prefer healthy paths  

DNS + load balancers + routing work together here.

---

## 🔁 Failure Domains vs Redundancy

Redundancy without isolation is useless.

Bad design:
- Two servers
- Same AZ
- Same subnet
- Same ToR

Looks redundant.  
Fails together.

Good design:
- Spread across failure domains
- Independent dependencies
- No shared choke points

---

## 🔐 Security and Blast Radius

Security failures also have blast radius.

Examples:
- Over-permissive firewall rules  
- Compromised credentials  
- Leaked API keys  

Good security design:
- Limits what a breach can touch  
- Contains lateral movement  
- Treats identity as a failure domain  

---

## 🏗️ Real-World Cloud Examples

**AWS:**
- AZ-based isolation  
- Cell-based control planes  
- Per-AZ load balancers  

**Azure:**
- Fault domains  
- Update domains  
- Zone-redundant services  

**GCP:**
- Zonal services  
- Regional load balancing  
- Cell-based networking  

All hyperscalers obsess over blast radius.  
That’s not paranoia. That’s experience.

## 🧾 Quick Recap

| Concept | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Failure Domain | Boundary of failure |
| Blast Radius | Scope of impact |
| AZ | Engineered failure boundary |
| Cell | Isolated cloud unit |
| Good Design | Fail small, not big |

---

## ⚡ In Simple Terms

Failures will happen.  
The only question is:

- Do **five things** break?  
- Or does **everything** break?

Cloud networking isn’t about uptime.  
It’s about **damage control**.

If your design can’t survive failure,  
it will eventually fail spectacularly.
