# ❓ Why Cloud Security Failures Are IAM Failures, Not Network Failures  
**Written By: Vinod Rathod**

## 🧠 Short Answer

**Network ke saath drama hota hai.**  
**IAM se actual damage hota hai.**

Most “cloud breaches” hacks nahi hote.  
They are **permission misuse with confidence**.

---

## 🧱 Old Excuse (Used Everywhere)

After breach, common lines:

> “Firewall misconfigured tha”  
> “Network rule galat tha”

**Reality check:**

- Firewall allowed traffic ❌  
- IAM allowed action ✅  

Network sirf **road** hai.  
Decision **IAM** leta hai.

---

## ☁️ Cloud Reality (Identity Runs Everything)

Cloud mein:

- Every API call is **authenticated**
- Every action is **authorized**
- Every service runs as an **identity**

Examples of identities:

- EC2 IAM Role  
- Kubernetes Service Account  
- CI/CD Pipeline Identity  
- Human SSO User  

No IAM → no cloud.  
So attackers focus **exactly yahin**.

## 🚨 Common IAM Failure Patterns (Daily Sightings)

### 1️⃣ Over-Permissioned Roles

Classic line:

> “Just give admin for now”

Reality of “for now”:

- 6 months  
- 12 services  
- Prod access  
- No audit  

**One stolen token → full account takeover.**

---

### 2️⃣ Identity Reuse Everywhere

Same IAM role used by:

- App  
- Cron job  
- Debug script  
- Backup job  

Then incident ke baad question:

> “Which workload did this?”

Answer:

> `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Identity reuse = zero attribution.

---

### 3️⃣ No Permission Boundaries

People say:

> “We trust our engineers”

Attackers **love** your trust culture.

Without boundaries:

- One compromised identity  
- Can create new identities  
- Can grant itself more permissions  

That’s not access control.  
That’s **recursion**.

---

## 🔐 Correct Mental Model (Lock This In)

> **Network decides reachability.**  
> **IAM decides capability.**

Attackers don’t care *where* they are.  
They care **what they can do**.

---

## 🧠 What Good IAM Actually Looks Like

### 1️⃣ Least Privilege (Real Version)

Not this:

> “ReadOnlyAccess”

But this:

> “This identity can call `GetObject` on **this** bucket, nothing else.”

Yes, it’s annoying.  
Security usually is.

---

### 2️⃣ Short-Lived Credentials

Never allow:

- Long-lived access keys  
- Static secrets  
- “Never-expiring” tokens  

Use instead:

- Workload identity  
- Auto-rotated credentials  

If credentials don’t expire, attackers don’t hurry.

---

### 3️⃣ Identity Separation

Separate identity for:

- Each service  
- Each environment  
- Each pipeline stage  

Rules that must never break:

- Prod ≠ Dev  
- Deploy ≠ Runtime  
- Human ≠ Machine  

Blur these lines and IAM collapses.

---

## 🧪 Real-World Proof (Not Theory)

Most real cloud breaches involved:

- Valid credentials  
- Legitimate API calls  
- No malware  
- No exploit chains  

Just permissions doing **exactly** what they were told.

Identity systems that matter:

- AWS IAM  
- Azure Active Directory  
- Google Cloud IAM  

Powerful tools.  
Dangerous defaults.

---

## ⚔️ Why IAM Failures Are Invisible at First

Because:

- Actions are **allowed**
- Logs look normal
- No firewall alerts
- No IDS triggers

Everything worked **as designed**.  
That’s the scary part.

---

## 🚨 Hard Truth (Again, Sorry)

If you say:

- “IAM is too complex”  
- “We’ll tighten permissions later”  
- “Admin is easier”  

Then your cloud is already compromised.  
It’s just **not noisy yet**.
