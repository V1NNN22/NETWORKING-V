## 🔐 What is Cloud Network Security?

**Definition:**  
Cloud Network Security refers to the **practices, technologies, and policies** that protect cloud networks, cloud-hosted applications, and data from **unauthorized access, attacks, and vulnerabilities**.  

**Purpose:**  
To ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA Triad)** of cloud resources while allowing **secure and efficient access** for legitimate users.

## 🛡️ Key Components of Cloud Network Security

### 1️⃣ Firewalls (Cloud-Based)
- Control inbound and outbound traffic based on rules.  
- **Types:** Network firewalls, Application firewalls, Web Application Firewalls (WAF)  
- **Example:** AWS WAF, Azure Firewall  

### 2️⃣ Security Groups & Network ACLs
- **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls at the **instance level**  
- **Network ACLs:** Control traffic at the **subnet level**  
- Enable **fine-grained access control**  

### 3️⃣ Encryption
- Protects data **in transit** (SSL/TLS, VPN) and **at rest** (AES, KMS)  
- Ensures data cannot be read if intercepted  

### 4️⃣ Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Controls **who** can access cloud resources and **what they can do**  
- Supports roles, policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- **Examples:** AWS IAM, Azure Active Directory  

### 5️⃣ Zero Trust Security
- Assumes **no user/device is trusted by default**  
- Requires **continuous verification** for every access request  

### 6️⃣ Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS)
- Monitors network traffic for **suspicious activity**  
- **IDS:** Alerts administrators  
- **IPS:** Actively blocks threats  

### 7️⃣ Monitoring & Logging
- Tracks network activity to detect anomalies and policy violations  
- **Tools:** AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail

## ✅ Cloud Network Security Best Practices

- Segment networks using **subnets, security groups, and VLANs**  
- Use **encryption** for all data in transit and at rest  
- Implement **least privilege access** with IAM roles and policies  
- Regularly **monitor and audit** network activity  
- Use **multi-layered security**: firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection  
- Automate security checks using **policies and cloud-native tools**
