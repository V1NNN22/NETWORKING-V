# 🕳️ Zero Trust Reality #6: Monitoring Exists, but Nobody Is Watching

## Written By: VINOD RATHOD 

Every org claims **“full visibility.”**  
Every breach proves that visibility was **decorative**.

The belief:

> “We log everything. We’ll detect it.”

You *did* log it.  
You just noticed **three months later** in a breach report written by someone else.

## ❌ Why Monitoring Fails in Zero Trust Setups

### 1️⃣ Too Many Signals, Zero Meaning

Zero Trust explodes telemetry:

- Auth logs  
- Network flows  
- API calls  
- Endpoint events  
- Cloud audit trails  

Teams drown in data and call it security.  
Noise wins. Signal suffocates.

More logs ≠ more awareness.  
It usually means less.

---

### 2️⃣ Alerts Are Tuned for Compliance, Not Attackers

Most alerts fire on:

- Login failures  
- Policy violations  
- Static thresholds  

Attackers don’t trip those. They:

- Use valid credentials  
- Stay under limits  
- Move slowly  

Your SIEM celebrates silence  
while the house empties.

---

### 3️⃣ Nobody Owns the Alert

When an alert fires:

- Security assumes it’s IT  
- IT assumes it’s DevOps  
- DevOps assumes it’s “expected behavior”  

So nothing happens.

Zero Trust becomes **Zero Responsibility**.

---

### 4️⃣ Detection Without Response Is Theater

Even when something is noticed:

- No authority to disable accounts  
- No confidence to kill sessions  
- No playbooks that won’t cause outages  

So teams “monitor” the attacker.  
Politely. Like wildlife photography.

---

## 🧨 The Ugly Truth

Zero Trust doesn’t fail at **prevention**.  
It fails at **decisive reaction**.

If your system can’t:

- Instantly revoke tokens  
- Kill active sessions  
- Isolate identities  
- Lock down blast radius  

Then monitoring is just **historical documentation of your loss**.

---

## ✅ What Actually Helps (And Yes, It’s Painful)

- Fewer alerts, brutally curated  
- Behavioral baselines **per identity**  
- Automatic response for high-confidence abuse  
- Session-level kill switches  
- Assume alerts are real until proven otherwise  

False positives are annoying.  
False negatives are catastrophic.

---

## 🧠 Final Reality Check

Logging everything is easy.  
Watching the *right* things and acting fast is hard.

If nobody is empowered to pull the plug,  
your observability stack is just a very expensive diary.
