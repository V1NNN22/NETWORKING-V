## ⚙️ What is Cloud Load Balancing?

**Definition:**  
Cloud Load Balancing is the process of **distributing incoming network traffic** across multiple servers, instances, or resources to ensure **high availability, performance, and reliability** in cloud environments.

**Purpose:**  
- Prevent overloading any single server.  
- Improve response time and fault tolerance.  
- Scale applications efficiently under heavy demand.

## 🔄 How Load Balancing Works

When users send requests to an application, the **load balancer acts as a traffic manager**, deciding which backend server should handle the request — based on performance, availability, or region.

## 🧱 Types of Load Balancers

| Type | Layer | Function | Example Use Case |
|------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** | Layer 4 (Transport) | Routes based on IP/TCP/UDP | Low-latency applications |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Layer 7 (Application) | Routes based on HTTP/HTTPS, URL, headers | Web apps & APIs |
| **Global Load Balancer** | Multi-region | Distributes traffic globally | Geo-routing and failover |
| **Internal Load Balancer** | Private network | Balances traffic inside VPC/VNet | Internal microservices |

---

## ⚙️ Load Balancing Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Round Robin** | Sequentially routes requests to each server in turn |
| **Least Connections** | Sends new traffic to server with fewest active sessions |
| **Weighted Round Robin** | Assigns priority (weight) to stronger servers |
| **IP Hash / Sticky Sessions** | Routes user to the same server based on IP or session |
| **Geolocation Routing** | Sends users to nearest or best-performing region |

## ☁️ Cloud Provider Load Balancers

| Provider | Service | Specialty |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **AWS** | Elastic Load Balancing (ALB, NLB, GLB) | Auto-scaling, cross-zone balancing |
| **Azure** | Azure Load Balancer / Application Gateway | Integration with Azure Front Door |
| **GCP** | Cloud Load Balancing | Global anycast-based load balancing |
| **Cloudflare / F5 / Avi Networks** | Multi-cloud load balancing | Global application delivery and DDoS protection |

## 🌐 What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?

**Definition:**  
A CDN is a **distributed network of edge servers** that deliver content (like images, videos, and files) from the **closest geographic location** to the user.

**Purpose:**  
- Reduce latency and load times.  
- Decrease bandwidth costs.  
- Improve global content availability.  

---

## 🧩 How CDN Works

1. The user requests content (e.g., image or video).  
2. The CDN checks if content is cached at the nearest edge location.  
3. If cached → served immediately.  
4. If not cached → fetched from the origin and cached for future requests.  

---

## 🏗️ CDN Architecture Components

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Origin Server** | Original source of content (e.g., S3 bucket, web server) |
| **Edge Servers / PoPs (Points of Presence)** | Geographically distributed servers that cache content |
| **DNS Routing** | Directs users to the nearest CDN edge node |
| **Cache / TTL Policies** | Control how long content stays cached |
| **HTTPS / SSL Offloading** | Encrypts traffic for security |

---

## 🌍 Popular CDN Providers

| Provider | Service | Highlights |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **AWS CloudFront** | Integrated with S3, ALB | Edge caching, DDoS protection |
| **Azure CDN / Front Door** | Global acceleration | Caching + Application Firewall |
| **Google Cloud CDN** | Integrated with Cloud Load Balancer | Anycast routing, high-speed delivery |
| **Cloudflare CDN** | Global edge presence | Security + performance optimization |
| **Akamai / Fastly** | Enterprise-grade CDN | Real-time caching and analytics |

## ⚡ Benefits of Load Balancing & CDN

| Feature | Load Balancer | CDN |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| **Primary Function** | Distribute traffic among servers | Deliver content closer to users |
| **Performance** | Prevents server overload | Reduces latency |
| **Availability** | Enables redundancy & failover | Maintains uptime globally |
| **Scalability** | Auto-adjusts based on demand | Handles spikes in global traffic |
| **Security** | SSL termination, DDoS mitigation | Edge security, WAF integration |

---

## 🧠 Integration Example

> A global e-commerce site uses:
> - **AWS ALB** to balance application traffic across EC2 instances.  
> - **CloudFront CDN** to cache product images at global edge locations.  
>  
> Together, they ensure **fast, secure, and reliable** user experience worldwide.

## ⚡ Quick Recap (Cloud Load Balancing & CDN)

| Concept | Goal | Example |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Load Balancer** | Distribute live traffic across servers | AWS ALB, Azure Gateway |
| **CDN** | Deliver cached content closer to users | CloudFront, Cloudflare |
| **Combined Result** | Speed + Availability + Scalability | Low latency + High uptime |

---

### 🧩 In Simple Terms:
> **Load Balancing** = Smart traffic distribution for live requests.  
> **CDN** = Fast delivery of cached content worldwide.
