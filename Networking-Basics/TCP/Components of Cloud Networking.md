## 🌐 What are Cloud Networking Components?

**Definition:**  
Cloud networking relies on a set of core components that allow cloud resources to **communicate**, stay **secure**, and remain **scalable**.  
These components replicate traditional networking elements but are **virtualized** and **managed in the cloud**.

**Purpose:**  
To provide a **structured**, **secure**, and **efficient network** within the cloud and between cloud and on-premises systems.

## ⚙️ Key Components of Cloud Networking

### 1️⃣ Virtual Network (VPC / VNet)  
- Logical network within the cloud for hosting resources.  
- Isolates cloud resources and controls communication.  
- **Example:** AWS VPC, Azure VNet, GCP VPC.  

### 2️⃣ Subnets  
- Segments within a virtual network to organize resources.  
- Can be **public** (internet-accessible) or **private** (internal use only).  
- Improves security and traffic management.  

### 3️⃣ Gateways  
- Devices/services that connect cloud networks to **external networks**.  
- **Types:**  
  - Internet Gateway → Connects to the internet  
  - VPN Gateway → Secure connection to on-premises  
  - Transit Gateway → Connects multiple VPCs  

### 4️⃣ Load Balancer  
- Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers/resources.  
- Ensures **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **scalability**.  
- **Types:** Layer 4 (Transport) & Layer 7 (Application) load balancing.  

### 5️⃣ Firewall / Security Groups / Network ACLs  
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic to cloud resources.  
- Firewalls: Stateful or stateless, filtering traffic based on IPs, ports, protocols.  
- Security groups: Virtual firewalls for instances.  

### 6️⃣ DNS (Domain Name System) & DHCP  
- **DNS:** Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses.  
- **DHCP:** Automatically assigns IP addresses to cloud resources.  

### 7️⃣ Virtual Network Interface Cards (vNICs)  
- Virtual adapters connecting cloud resources to the virtual network.  
- Each vNIC has a **private IP** and optionally a **public IP**.

## ⚡ Optional / Advanced Components

- **Peering Connections:** Connects two virtual networks privately.  
- **Cloud Interconnect / Direct Connect / ExpressRoute:** Private, high-speed on-prem to cloud connections.  
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Secures communication over public networks.  
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Distributes content globally for faster access.

| **Component** | **Purpose / Role** | **Example** |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Virtual Network (VPC/VNet) | Logical network for resources | AWS VPC, Azure VNet |
| Subnets | Divide network for organization & security | Public / Private subnets |
| Gateways | Connect cloud to external networks | Internet Gateway, VPN Gateway |
| Load Balancer | Distribute traffic, improve availability | ELB, Azure LB |
| Firewall / Security Groups | Control access & traffic | AWS SG, Azure NSG |
| DNS / DHCP | Name resolution and IP assignment | Route 53, Azure DNS |
| vNICs | Connect resources to virtual networks | Elastic NIC, Azure NIC |
