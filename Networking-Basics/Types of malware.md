## üî• What is a Firewall?  
- **Definition:** A firewall is a network security device/software that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.  
- **Purpose:** Acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network (e.g., Internet).  
- **Placement:** Typically sits at the boundary of private networks and the Internet.

## üõ°Ô∏è Types of Firewalls  

### 1. Packet-Filtering Firewall  
- Inspects data packets individually.  
- Decisions based on **IP address, port number, protocol**.  
- Fast, but limited (does not inspect payload).  
- **Example:** Basic router ACLs.  

---

### 2. Stateful Inspection Firewall  
- Tracks the **state of active connections**.  
- Only allows packets that match a valid, established connection.  
- More secure than packet filtering.  
- **Example:** Enterprise network firewalls.  

---

### 3. Proxy Firewall (Application-Level Gateway)  
- Acts as an **intermediary** between client and server.  
- Inspects data at the **application layer (Layer 7)**.  
- Can filter specific protocols (**HTTP, FTP, etc.**).  
- **Limitation:** Slower performance.

### 4. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)  
- Combines traditional firewall + advanced features:  
  - Deep packet inspection.  
  - Intrusion Prevention System (**IPS**).  
  - Application awareness & control.  
- Provides the **highest level of security**.  

---

### 5. Circuit-Level Gateway  
- Works at the **session layer (Layer 5)**.  
- Verifies **handshakes (sessions)** between TCP/UDP connections.  
- Does not inspect actual data, only ensures session legitimacy.  

---

### 6. Cloud Firewalls (Firewall as a Service ‚Äì FWaaS)  
- **Hosted in the cloud**.  
- Scalable with **centralized management**.  
- Often used in **modern cloud/hybrid environments**.

## ‚ö° Quick Recap (Firewall Types & Roles)  

| Type | OSI Layer | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Packet-Filtering** | Network (L3) | Filters based on IP, ports, protocols |
| **Stateful Inspection** | Network/Transport | Tracks active connections |
| **Proxy Firewall** | Application (L7) | Acts as intermediary, inspects payload |
| **Circuit-Level Gateway** | Session (L5) | Verifies sessions/handshakes |
| **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)** | Multi-layer | Deep inspection, IPS, app control |
| **Cloud Firewall (FWaaS)** | Cloud-based | Scalable, centralized firewall service |
