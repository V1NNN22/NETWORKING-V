## Transmission Modes: Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex  


### Simplex Mode  
- **Definition:** Data flows in only one direction.  
- **Communication type:** One-way only (like a broadcast).  
- **Examples:**  
  - Television → signal goes from broadcaster to your TV, no return path.  
  - Keyboard → sends input to computer, but computer does not send data back to keyboard.  
- **Key Point:** Simplex = One-way communication.

### Half-Duplex Mode  
- **Definition:** Data flows in both directions, but only one side at a time.  
- **Communication type:** Alternating two-way. One device must wait while the other sends.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Walkie-talkies → when one person speaks, the other must wait.  
  - Old CB radios.  
- **Key Point:** Half-Duplex = Two-way, but one at a time.  

---

### Full-Duplex Mode  
- **Definition:** Data flows in both directions at the same time.  
- **Communication type:** True simultaneous two-way communication.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Telephone/mobile calls → both people can talk and listen at once.  
  - Modern computer networks (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).  
- **Key Point:** Full-Duplex = Two-way, simultaneously.

## Quick Comparison  
- **Simplex:** One-way only → e.g., TV, keyboard  
- **Half-Duplex:** Two-way, but turn by turn → e.g., walkie-talkie  
- **Full-Duplex:** Two-way at the same time → e.g., phone call, modern networks
