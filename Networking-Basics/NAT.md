## üåç What is NAT?  
- **Definition:** NAT is a method used by **routers/firewalls** to translate **private IP addresses** within a LAN into a **public IP address** (and vice versa) for communication over the Internet.  
- **Purpose:** Allows multiple devices in a private network to **share a single public IP address**.  
- **Layer:** Operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.  

---

## ‚ùì Why NAT is Needed?  
- IPv4 addresses are **limited (~4.3 billion total)**.  
- NAT helps **conserve public IP addresses**.  
- Provides a layer of **security** (hides internal IPs from the outside world).  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of NAT  

### 1. Static NAT (SNAT)  
- One **private IP ‚Üî one public IP** (one-to-one mapping).  
- Used when a device inside the LAN needs to be **accessible from outside** (e.g., web server).  

---

### 2. Dynamic NAT (DNAT)  
- Private IPs are mapped to available **public IPs from a pool**.  
- Mapping changes **dynamically** depending on availability.  

---

### 3. PAT (Port Address Translation) / NAT Overload  
- Many private IPs share **one public IP**, differentiated by **port numbers**.  
- Most common form of NAT (**used in home routers**).  
- **Example:** Multiple devices browsing the Internet through one ISP-provided IP.  

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of NAT  
- Conserves **public IP addresses**.  
- Adds **privacy/security** (internal IPs hidden).  
- Flexible ‚Äî supports both **static and dynamic mappings**.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages of NAT  
- Can cause **delays** due to translation overhead.  
- Some applications (**VoIP, peer-to-peer**) may face issues.  
- Breaks **true end-to-end connectivity**.

## ‚ö° Quick Recap (Types of NAT)  

| Type         | Mapping                  | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Static NAT**   | One private ‚Üî One public   | Hosting servers inside LAN |
| **Dynamic NAT**  | Private ‚Üî Public pool      | Enterprises with multiple available IPs |
| **PAT / Overload** | Many private ‚Üî One public | Home/office Internet sharing |
